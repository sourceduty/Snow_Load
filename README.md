[Snow Load](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-4ZK2PHvVE-snow-load) was developed to to assist users in calculating the snow load on a roof based on several inputs. It first guides the user to select the type of snow from a predefined list, each with specific characteristics such as density. The user is then asked to enter details about the roof, including the slope or pitch and its dimensions. After collecting these inputs, the GPT uses a set of preloaded formulas and conversion factors to calculate the snow load in both imperial and metric units, providing a detailed report on the weight of snow that the roof is currently supporting.

The system is tailored to ensure accurate and efficient snow load calculations, which is crucial for assessing the structural integrity of buildings in snowy regions. By integrating knowledge from several datasets, including snow types, roof pitches, and mathematical formulas, this GPT helps users make informed decisions about potential snow hazards. The results can be used to determine whether additional actions, such as snow removal, are necessary to prevent damage to the roof or the structure as a whole.
